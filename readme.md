TodoMVC - Mojito
================


Mojito is an MVC framework written in pure JavaScript on NodeJS. Allows easy development of web applications - across devices.


Examples
========

- `todomvc-mojito-common`: Uses Mojito MVC structure and no other frameworks for code abstraction. Uses common affinity for model and controller, and local storage for persistence.
- `todomvc-mojito-server`: Same as `todomvc-mojito-common` but with server affinity for model and controller, and uses memory for persistence. Demonstrates easy and fast application development - how one can prototype an application and move to production with minimal changes.
- `todomvc-mojito-yui`: Uses YUI MVC on top of Mojito MVC. Demonstrates how one can migrate to Mojito
- `todomvc-mojito-jquery`: Coolest part - how one can migrate jQuery based application to Mojito
